//* Exclude backreferences
//! In simple cases of circular references, we can exclude an offending property from serialization by its name.
//! But sometimes we can’t just use the name, as it may be used both in circular references and normal properties.
//! So we can check the property by its value.
//! Write replacer function to stringify everything, but remove properties that reference meetup:

let room = {
  number: 23,
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  occupiedBy: [{ name: "John" }, { name: "Alice" }],
  place: room,
};

// circular references
room.occupiedBy = meetup;
meetup.self = meetup;

console.log(
  JSON.stringify(meetup, function replacer(key, value) {
    return key !== "" && value === meetup ? undefined : value;
  })
